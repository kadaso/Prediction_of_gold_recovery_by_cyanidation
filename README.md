Application of ANN to model and predict gold recovery by cyanidation - a case study of a University final year project conducted in 2018.
This is a sample deep learning project on significantly small dataset of gold cyanidation data. Often, ANNs performance is improved with the amount of data in the dataset.
Statistical data preprocessing (such as Grey Relational Analysis) will be conducted on later stages in an attempt to improve model performance.
